I think spending more time on the phone is time that i have less for my hobbies. Maybe a gadget like a bracelet or keychain would help to make it more usable. I am also fully employed and not a student anymore so i actually don't feel like the target group. Also you said that you are working on a solution to the scrollingproblem on the mobile website but it never happened gives the feeling that you guys don't care about the study. Why is the input field for the feedback so small? ",Yes
